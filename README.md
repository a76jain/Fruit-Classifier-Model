# Fruit Classifier(Smart Farming)

### Description

- This model is developed from scratch using Convolutonal Neural Network with Training accuracy of 99.47% and Testing accuracy of 97.68%.
- Fruit Classifier model is developed as a part of Udacity Machine Learning Advanced Nanodegree Course.
- This project is inspired by topic of use of robots for farming, which I found really the need of time.
- Please feel free to give suggestions for improving Model.

### Outcomes

- Model has was 98% for training dataset and 97% for testing dataset.
- Paper for the proposal of this project can be found at https://github.com/satishf889/Fruit-Classifier-Proposal.
